## Global dependencies

Requires Gulp globally installed:

```shell
npm install --global gulp
```

## Building the code

Download & install all dependencies, build, bundle & package the project

```shell
# download & install dependencies
npm install

# transpile all TypeScript & SCSS => JavaScript & CSS
gulp build

# create component bundle & manifest
gulp bundle

# create SharePoint package
gulp package-solution
```

These commands produce the following:

- **./lib**: intermediate-stage commonjs build artifacts
- **./dist**: bundled script, along with other resources
- **./temp/deploy**: all resources required by component(s) to deploy to a CDN (when `--ship` argument present)

## Build options

- `gulp clean`: Deletes all build output (**/dist**, **/lib**, **/temp**, etc.).
- `gulp build`: Transpiles all TypeScript & SCSS to JavaScript & CSS, generates source map files & TypeScript type declaration files
- `gulp bundle [--ship|-p|--production]`: Runs gulp task **build**, then uses webpack to create the JavaScript bundle(s) and component manifest(s) as defined in **./config/config.json**. The `--ship`, `-p` or `--production` argument specifies a production build that will generate minified bundles.
- `gulp serve [--ship|-p|--production]`: Runs gulp tasks **build**, **bundle** & starts the local webserver. Depending on the project type, it opens the browser and navigates to the local workbench or specified URL (in the case of extension components). The `--ship`, `-p` or `--production` argument specifies a production build that modifies the resulting package for production hosting rather than local hosting of assets.
- `gulp package-solution`: Creates the SharePoint Package (**.sppkg**) file.
- `gulp dist`: Creates a production-ready SharePoint Package (**.sppkg**) file. The following gulp task gets executed in this specific order `gulp clean`, `gulp bundle`, `gulp package-solution.`
- `gulp dev`: Creates a development-ready SharePoint Package (**.sppkg**) file. The following gulp task will be executed in this specific order `gulp clean`, `gulp bundle`, `gulp package-solution.`

> View all available gulp tasks by running `gulp --tasks`

##  Deploy to App Catalog

Add the packahe to Tenant App Catalog and global Deploy de Solution.  After goto SharePoint Admin Center and approve the required permisstions. 

The Application Customizer is installed globally (tenant-wide), and an entry was added in the list "Tenant Wide Extensions" located in Tenant App Catalog Site. 

The Application Customizer has a required parameter called "functionAppUrl", this parameter must have the function Apps URL where the Azure Function are located and must be defined after deployed.

example :

{"functionAppUrl":"https://xxxxxxx.azurewebsites.net"}
